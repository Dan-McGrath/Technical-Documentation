                <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-orented scripting language. It is a versitale, lightweight language, primarily seen in web development.
                    JavaScript contains a stadard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures,
                    and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes either for the Frontend (client-side) or the Backend (server-side).

                <h3>Console</h3>
                <p>
                    In JavaScript the console is a panel that displays important messages, like errors, for developers. Much of
                    the code is hidden by default so if we want to see things appear on our screen, we can print, or log, to our console 
                    directly. In JavaScript the console keyword refers to an <a href="#objects">object</a> that we can use in our code. 
                    Keywords  are words that developers have built into the language. By doing this the computer will recognize them out of
                    the box and will treat them differently. One method that is built into the console onject is the <code>.log()</code> method.
                    When we write <code>console.log();</code> , whatever we put inside the parentheses will get printed, or logged, to the console.
                    <code class="example">Input:<br>console.log('Hello World');<br>Output: <br>Hello World</code> 
                    This helps us see what our code is doing. We can use this to see what a <a href="variables">variables</a> value is, or 
                    to help with <a href="#error-handling">error-handling</a> as well as many other use cases. We add a semicolon to the end of our code to
                    indicate the end of the line, or statement. While JavaScript will usually run as intended without it, it is common practice to use it for 
                    the small cases that they are needed.
                </p>
                <h3>Comments</h3>
                <p>
                    Code can quicly become hard to undestand after time away from the project. For this reason and others it is best practice to leave notes, or comments, 
                    in our code not just for ourselves but for anyone else they may need to read and understand our code. JavaScript allows us to write comments without it affecting our code.
                    There are two types of of comments JavaScript allows us to use. There are single line comments:
                    <code class="example">// Im a single line comment</code>A single line comment will only comment out a single line and is denoted with two forward slashes <code>//</code>.
                    We can also use a comment with a multi-line comment:
                    <code class="example">/*<br> I am also a comment <br> */</code> A multi-line comment begins with <code>/*</code> and ends with <code>*/</code>. 
                </p>
                <h3>Data Types</h3>
                <p>
                    Data Types are the classifications we give to differnt kinds of data tha we use in that particular programming language.
                    In JavaScript there are seven fundamental data types:
                </p>
                <ul class="datatypes-list">
                    <li>
                    <p><span>Number</span>: <br>Any number, including numbers with decimals</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><span>String</span>: <br>Any grouping of characters on your keyboard surrounded by single quotes or double quotes</p>
                        <p>A semantic way of saying 'Text'</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><span>Boolean</span>: <br>This data type only has two possible values- either True or False</p>
                        <p>Can be though of like a light switch. It is either on or off</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><span>Null</span>: <br>This data type represents the intentional absences of a value, and is represented by the keyword <code>null</code></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><span>Undefined</span>: <br>This data type is denoted by the keyword <code>undefined</code></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><span>Symbol</span>: <br>A unique identifier, useful in more complex coding</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><span>Object</span>: <br>Collections of related data</p>
                    </li>                        
                </ul>
                <p>  
                    The first 6 of these data types are considerd primitive data types and are the most
                    basic data types of the language. Objects tend to be a more complex data type.
                </p>
                <h3>Arithmetic Operators</h3>
                <p>
                    Many times its helpful to use basic math in programming. JavaScript allows
                    us to do this with its arithmetic operators. Operator is a term used for a charecter that preforms a specific task
                    in our code. JavaScript has several built-in arithmetic operators. These operators let us preform
                    mathematical calculations numbers in our code.<br> Add: + <br>Subtract: - <br>Multiply: * <br>Divide: / <br>Remainder: % <br>
                    The first four will work as you would expect, but the remainder operator, or the modulo, returns the remainder.
                </p>
                <h3>String Concatenation</h3>
                <p>
                    Operators arn't just used for numbers. When a <code>+</code> operator is used on two strings,
                    it appends the right string to the left string. This process of appending one string to another is called Concatenation.
                    The computer will join the strings exactly where we tell it too. So we need to be sure to add spaces manually if needed. 
                    We can use this to chain string together just like adding integers.
                    <code class="example">
                        Input: <br>
                        console.log("hello " + "world, " + "my name is" + " Dan"); <br>
                        Output: <br>
                        hello world, my name is Dan
                    </code>
                </p>
                <h3>Properties</h3>
                <p>
                    Any time we introduce a new peice of data into JavaScript, the browser saves it as an instance of the data type that we used.
                    All data types have access to specific properties that are passed down to each instance of that data type
                    For example, every string instance has a property called length that stores the number of charecters that are in that string.
                    You can retrieve property data by using the dot operator <code>.</code>. We use the dot operator by appending the operator with the 
                    propery name.
                    <code class="example scroll">
                        Input: <br>
                        console.log('dan'.length); <br>
                        Output: <br>
                        3
                    </code>
                </p>
                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>
                    Methods are actions we can preform. Data types have access to specific methods 
                    that allow us to handle instances of that data type. We can use these methods or 'call' them by <br>
                    appending an instance with the dot operator, the name of the method and opening and closing parentheses:
                    <code class="example scroll">
                        'exampleString'.methodName();
                    </code>
                </p>
                <h3>Built-in objects</h3>
                <p>
                    In addition to console, there are other objects built into JavaScript. To perform more complex mathematical operations you can use the Math object 
                    The good thing about objects is that they have there own methods for us to take advantage of.
